<b>Bio:</b> American basketball star Michael Jordan was born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York. Jordan left
college after his junior year to join the NBA. Drafted by the Chicago Bulls, he helped the team make it to the playoffs.
For his efforts there, Jordan received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. With five regular-season MVPs and three
All-Star MVPs, Jordan became the most decorated player in the NBA.

Personal Life and Legacy

In 2006, Jordan bought a share of the Charlotte Bobcats and joined the team's executive ranks as its managing member of
basketball operations. He experienced some personal changes that same year, ending his 17-year marriage to wife Juanita
Vanoy. The couple divorced in December 2006. They had three children together during the course of their marriage:
Jeffrey, Marcus and Jasmine.

The following year, Michael Jordan made newsâ€”this time as the father of an up-and-coming college basketball player.
His eldest son, Jeffrey Jordan, made the team at the University of Illinois. Both Michael Jordan and his ex-wife Juanita
have supported their son and tried to help him deal with playing in the shadow of a NBA legend. "He wants to be a
basketball player, but he wants to do it on his own terms ...The thing that we have tried to tell Jeff is that you set
your own expectations. By no means in this world can you ever live up someone else's expectations of who you
are," Michael Jordan said during an appearance on the Today show.

In April 2009, Jordan received one of basketball's greatest honors: He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame. Attending the induction ceremony was a bittersweet affair for Jordan because being at the even
t meant "your basketball career is completely over," he explained.

While he may not be playing on the court, Jordan remains active in his sport. He became the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats in 2010 and serves as the team's chairman. And improving the team's less-than-stellar record seems to be Jordan's number one priority these days. He told ESPN in November 2012 that "I don't anticipate getting out of this business. My competitive nature is I want to succeed. It's always been said that when I can't find a way to do anything, I will find a way to do it."

Outside of his work with the Charlotte Bobcats, Jordan is involved in a number of business ventures, including several restaurants. He also does a lot for charity, including hosting the annual golf event known as the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational.

In 2016, Jordan was presented with a Presidential Medal of Freedom honor by Barack Obama.

Jordan married 35-year-old Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto on April 27, 2013, in Palm Beach, Florida. Tiger Woods, Spike Lee and Patrick Ewing, among other celebrities, reportedly attended the wedding ceremony. The couple welcomed twin daughters, Victoria and Ysabel, in February 2014.
